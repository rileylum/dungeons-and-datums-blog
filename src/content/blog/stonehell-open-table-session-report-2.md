# Stonehell Open Table - Session Report #2

Mellwyn the Unexceptional once again headed back to Stonehell in search of treasure and knowledge, this time accompanied by two sturdy fighting men — Sakhr and Amadeus the Disposable — and the crafty thief Skeeve.

They thought it wise to explore the valley and become familiar with their surroundings before delving into Stonehell itself.

The initial ruins were empty, save for a statue of a warrior where Skeeve traded his trusty dagger — perhaps he would wish he had it later — for a helm that had been left beside it.

They then set about exploring the caves visible along the valley walls.

Their first discovery was a stone chamber carved into the rock. There they quickly disposed of a Fire Beetle and avoided a lurking Green Slime. The next chamber they searched along the southern wall was not so forgiving.

Skeeve, carefully scouting ahead, was surprised by six Skeletons — their piercing blue eyes gleaming in the dark. The rush of bony arms and rusted blades was the last thing he saw before blacking out.

The Skeletons were then met by the rest of the party. The veteran fighters Sakhr and Amadeus quickly dispatched them with the aid of Mellwyn.

Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, Skeeve had survived. His leg was shattered and would need amputation. The party stabilized him and brought him to the Gatehouse to rest before returning to town.

Two more caves remained. These were natural — the first housed a huge Black Bear, who oddly seemed to have piled arms, armor, and rations neatly at the entrance, with a larger hoard further inside. Mellwyn neutralized the threat with his Color Spray spell, and they chose to spare the creature.

The final cave appeared to belong to a large cat, though it was thankfully away hunting. Within they found the remains of a brigand and the ruins of old lodgings, but nothing else of value.

The party returned home, dragging the injured Skeeve along — his adventuring days over before they could truly begin.
