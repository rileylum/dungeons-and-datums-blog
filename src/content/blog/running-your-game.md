Okay so I gave some advice to Jason Wiebe of the Dungeon Plunger Podcast "I say run what you want and run it enthusiastically and the players will come, or they won't [...]" and I think when you give advice you should consider it yourself also, and so thats what I've been doing.

Currently I'm running an Open Table Stonehell game with OD&D + Chaimail, is it the game I want to run? Nope, not really. And I don't mean that I'm not enjoying running it, but if I could choose I'd be doing something else. The reason I am running this game is because it was super quick to start running, and I'd rather be playing SOMETHING than waiting to figure out what I actually want to play, developing it and so on. This is also important to consider, don't let overthinking and procastionation get in the way of PLAY.

I'm also running games at conventions, this upcoming one I'm running DCC Lankhmar. Is this what I want to be playing? I'm not sure, part of me is excited to run it, I like DCC and I love Lankhmar. But I also feel a bit disappointed to not be running something I created. I'm charging ahead either way (I promised to run the module when I bought it from someone).

Anyway back to the game I want to play, and I don't mean system - I mean the amalgamation of system, setting and playstyle. So how do you even come up with an answer to this? I don't know but I'm going to try and pose myself some questions that I think might be useful, then try and answer them and repeat hopefully getting closer to the end goal. I've included some resources for where I pull some questions from.

An important part of this process is me closing my eyes and envisioning what is happening at the table, or what I want to be happening at the table. Can I see the players crawling into dungeons? What does the dungeon look like? What do the characters look like? What challenges do they face in a dungeon? 

As an example do I see the Anime style depicition of a dungeon ala Dungeon Delicious, all clean and light, right next to town with a mix of classes and fantasy species. Or is it dark and grimy, the characters are all roguish types barely able to see through the dim light and smoke of their torch all destined to die in a far off dungeon in the middle of a desert?

We should also gather a list of inspiration material, our appendix N. A good starting point is obviously listing all the material you find generally inspriational or at least enjoyable and reviewing whether its a fit for the game you want why/why not. This should help you generate a picture, but also be a useful artefact
