# Stonehell Open Table - Session Report #4

The explorers once more plumbed the depths of Stonehell. Veterans of the halls—Mellwyn the Unexceptional, Gregwyn, and John Trawler—were joined by the brave fighter Duncan. As ever, they descended the long stairs into the earth.

Their first aim was to press into the halls they had abandoned on their last expedition. There they spotted a group of orcs manning what appeared to be a guard post. Though the party approached unseen, the orcs' numbers, and a nearby alarm gong giving them pause. Discretion won out.

They continued south, then east, where they discovered a strange glyph carved into the wall. Touching it transported them into a wizard's laboratory, seemingly disconnected from the dungeon entirely. This proved a fortunate find: a spellbook promised new magic for the party's spell-casters and a tidy reward for delivering this news to the local wizard. Returning via the glyph, they pressed on through a chamber of ruined statuary and found another stairway leading down.

The lower level was unsettling from the start. The party scouted cautiously, taking in blood-written warnings, skull-marked doors, and one ominous inscription declaring the dead within. Assuming some of these might be bluffs, they opened the latter door to reveal a coffin, chained and nailed shut. This was warning enough. They withdrew and retreated back to the upper level.

Choosing safety over bravado, the adventurers turned to exploring and mapping the first dungeon level. They briefly passed through the ogre-mouthed corridor to the north, noting a natural cave marked with a metal sign reading "Da' Dragon's Den." Wisely, they headed east instead.

A debris-choked room came next. Failing to heed lessons learned from their earlier rat encounter, the party disturbed its inhabitants—three spitting cobras. Once again, a timely use of Colour Spray from the magic-users neutralised the threat. Beyond this lay a chamber scarred by fire and a room filled with rusted weapons, and skeletal remains. Little of value remained.

More enticing was the smell of cooking meat drifting from the southern passage. Following it, the party discovered a group of debased savages, filthy and half-mad from cannibalism. A swift application of Colour Spray ended the encounter. One captive was questioned; though his mind was broken, it became clear these creatures were descendants of the dungeon's original inhabitants.

With modest loot, fresh scars, and valuable news for the local wizard, the adventurers returned to town. As winter set in, the adventuring season drew to a temporary close.
