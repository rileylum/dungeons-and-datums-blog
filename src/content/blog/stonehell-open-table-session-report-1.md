# Stonehell Open Table - Session Report #1

Olaf Sausage Fingers, the Thief; Dimigul, the Fighter; and Mellwyn the Unexception, the MU braved the Gates of Hell to clear out the goblin menace, accompanied by 5 of the local militia.

Proceeding cautiously they surprised a small group of Goblins lazily ignoring their watch duty, but their inexperience almost cost them as the Goblins managed to fight back and hold long enough to raise the alarm, rousing the main force. Dimigul and the Militia duked it out in the corridors, leaving a trail of blood and gore - 6 goblins and 3 militia dead, a further 2 goblins captured to be interrogated later.

Exploring the rest of the Gatehouse, they recovered a cask of fine wine overcoming the wasps with clever use of smoke, took out a nest of Stirges with a volley of missile fire, recovering a gem from the stirges previous victim, much to Olaf's delight. Finally the judicious use of sorcery for Mellwyn the Unexceptional, unfortunately living up to his name, was only able to stun 2 of the 4 Giant Centipedes, but a volley of missiles saved the day once again.

Olaf Sausage Fingers, did not live up to his name though, discovering a secret door and two magic items, A cloak that protects the wearer from all but the worst weather and a parasol which protects the user from magical cold whilst it is open and held.

They return to town triumphant, goblin prisoners in tow.
